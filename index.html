						<h1>Abbreviated conversations about this and that and architecture</h1>
						<p>Text messages are like love notes – brief, sparse and intimate. They reveal different things than spoken conversation – different selves.</p>
						<p>We asked some friends who happen to be architects if they'd mind us eavesdropping on their text chat for a week or so and publishing it on a website. They said yes, so we did.</p>
						<p>We asked if they had friends who would do the same. They said yes again, so we're going to start posting more chats – maybe one a month or something.</p>
						<p>Check in from time to time and eavesdrop on architects chatting by text about... whatever architects chat about.</p>
						<p><strong>Or we can email you snippets of chats when we post them.</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Or... leave us your number and we'll text you when there's something new on the site. Don't worry, we won't call you. Phone calls aren't really our thing.</strong></p>
